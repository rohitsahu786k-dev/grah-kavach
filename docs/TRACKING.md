# Graha Kavach — Order Shipment Tracking

**Status:** Phase 5 complete. AST installed, configured and tested end-to-end.
**Last verified:** 2026-09-20 (dummy order, since deleted)

---

## 1. What is installed

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Plugin | **Advanced Shipment Tracking for WooCommerce** (AST) |
| Author | Zorem — official wordpress.org build, slug `woo-advanced-shipment-tracking` |
| Version | 4.0.3 |
| Cost | Free, open source. **No TrackShip, no paid service installed.** |

### Compatibility, checked before activation

| Requirement | AST 4.0.3 | This install | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WordPress | requires 5.3, tested 7.1 | 7.1.1 | ✅ |
| WooCommerce | requires 5.0, tested **11.1.0** | **11.1.1** | ⚠️ one patch ahead |
| PHP | requires 7.2 | 8.3.33 | ✅ |
| HPOS | supported | available | ✅ |

The WooCommerce gap is a patch release, not a minor one. Everything in this
document was exercised against 11.1.1 and worked. Re-check after any AST or
WooCommerce upgrade.

## 2. ⚠️ AST does not create a "Shipped" order status

This is the single most important thing to know, and it is not what the plugin
name suggests. It was confirmed by reading AST's source and then by a live test.

`wc_ast_status_shipped` does **not** register a new order status. It only
changes the wording of the admin "Mark order as:" radio button from *Completed*
to *Shipped* (`class-wc-advanced-shipment-tracking.php:553-563`). AST registers
post statuses for `wc-delivered`, `wc-updated-tracking` and `wc-partial-shipped`
— but **never** `wc-shipped`.

Proven on the dummy order:

```
POST /wc/v3/orders/33/shipment-trackings  { ..., "status_shipped": 1 }
     → 201 Created
GET  /wc/v3/orders/33
     → "status": "completed"        ← not "shipped"
```

`partial-shipped` was enabled in settings but is **still not reachable over
REST**: it is absent from `/wc/v3/orders/statuses`, and setting it returns
`rest_invalid_param`. AST registers it only in an admin context, so a headless
frontend cannot rely on it.

### What this means for the frontend

**Do not branch on a `shipped` status — it does not exist.** Derive the
fulfilment state from the order status *plus* the presence of tracking:

| Woo status | Tracking items | Show the customer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pending`, `failed` | — | Awaiting payment |
| `on-hold` | — | Payment being confirmed |
| `processing` | none | Preparing your order |
| `processing` | ≥ 1 | **Shipped** — show tracking |
| `completed` | ≥ 1 | **Shipped** — show tracking |
| `completed` | none | Completed |
| `cancelled`, `refunded` | — | Cancelled / Refunded |

The `derive` logic belongs in one place in the frontend, not scattered per page.

---

## 3. Does AST alone satisfy the five requirements?

| # | Requirement | AST free | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tracking number display | ✅ **Yes** | `tracking_number` |
| 2 | Carrier display | ✅ **Yes** | `tracking_provider`, human-readable ("Delhivery") |
| 3 | Tracking link | ✅ **Yes** | `tracking_link`, **already substituted** — the frontend never builds URLs |
| 4 | Shipped status | ⚠️ **No, not as a status** | Maps to `completed`; derive per §2 |
| 5 | Frontend Track Order page | ❌ **No** | AST renders into WooCommerce My Account and emails only. A headless page must be built — see §6 |

**Verdict:** AST covers the data layer completely (1–3). Requirement 4 needs a
documented convention rather than a plugin feature. Requirement 5 is ours to build.

---

## 4. Configuration applied

**Statuses** (`ast_general_settings`)

- `wc_ast_status_shipped` → `true` — admin action reads "Shipped"
- `wc_ast_status_partial_shipped` → `true` — admin only, not REST-visible
- `wc_ast_status_delivered` → `false` — nothing would ever set it without
  real-time carrier events, so an always-empty status would mislead

**Carriers** — 9 activated from 1078 available, all Indian, and every one has a
`%number%` placeholder so the tracking link actually resolves. Carriers whose
stored URL has no placeholder (Gati, Safexpress, Trackon, The Professional
Couriers) were deliberately left off: they would produce a dead link.

| Carrier | Tracking URL pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Delhivery | `delhivery.com/track-v2/package/%number%` |
| India Post | `indiapost.gov.in/track-result/article-number/%number%` |
| DTDC | `dtdc.com/track-your-shipment/?awb=%number%` |
| Xpressbees | `xpressbees.com/shipment/tracking?awbNo=%number%` |
| Bluedart | `bluedart.com/?%number%` |
| Ekart | `ekartlogistics.com/shipmenttrack/%number%/` |
| Shadowfax | `track.shadowfax.in/track?order=new&trackingId=%number%` |
| TCI Express | `tciexpress.in/trackingdocket.aspx?trackshipment=%number%` |
| Shiprocket | `shiprocket.co/tracking/%number%` |

Add more in **WooCommerce → Shipment Tracking → Shipping Providers**.

## 5. REST API — verified working

AST registers under four namespaces; they are the same routes. **Use `wc/v3`.**

```
GET    /wp-json/wc/v3/orders/{order_id}/shipment-trackings
POST   /wp-json/wc/v3/orders/{order_id}/shipment-trackings
DELETE /wp-json/wc/v3/orders/{order_id}/shipment-trackings/{tracking_id}
GET    /wp-json/wc/v3/orders/{order_id}/shipment-trackings/providers
```

Authentication is the standard WooCommerce consumer key/secret — **server-side
only**, never in a browser.

### Verified response

```json
[
  {
    "tracking_id": "1a74566ba8db99e6b4e02c98c932ab8e",
    "tracking_provider": "Delhivery",
    "tracking_link": "https://www.delhivery.com/track-v2/package/TESTDLV123456789",
    "tracking_number": "TESTDLV123456789",
    "date_shipped": "2026-09-20"
  }
]
```

`tracking_link` arrives fully resolved. `date_shipped` is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Adding tracking

```json
POST /wp-json/wc/v3/orders/{id}/shipment-trackings
{
  "tracking_provider": "Delhivery",
  "tracking_number":   "ABC123456789",
  "date_shipped":      "2026-09-20",
  "status_shipped":    1
}
```

`status_shipped: 1` moves the order to `completed` and triggers the customer
email. Omit it to attach tracking without changing status or notifying.

### What the Store API does *not* give you

`/wc/store/v1/order/{id}?key=…&billing_email=…` works anonymously and returns
status, items, totals and addresses — but **contains no tracking data at all**
(verified). It cannot back a Track Order page on its own.

---

## 6. Service contract for the Next.js frontend

> **The frontend must never scrape WooCommerce HTML, and the consumer
> key/secret must never reach the browser.** Both are satisfied by putting a
> single server-side route between the customer and WooCommerce.

### Route

```
POST /api/track
```

Runs server-side in Next.js. It is the only place that holds Woo credentials.

**Request**

```ts
{ orderNumber: string; email: string }
```

What a customer actually knows from their confirmation email. No order key
required, so the page works from a bookmark.

**Response — 200**

```ts
type TrackingResponse = {
  orderNumber: string;
  placedOn: string;              // ISO 8601
  state: "awaiting_payment" | "confirming" | "preparing"
       | "shipped" | "completed" | "cancelled" | "refunded";
  isShipped: boolean;            // derived per §2
  shipments: {
    carrier: string;             // "Delhivery"
    trackingNumber: string;
    trackingUrl: string;         // already resolved — render as-is
    shippedOn: string | null;    // YYYY-MM-DD
  }[];
  items: { name: string; quantity: number }[];
};
```

**Response — 404** `{ error: "not_found" }` — returned for *both* a missing
order and a mismatched email, so the endpoint cannot be used to test whether an
email address has ordered.

**Response — 429** `{ error: "rate_limited" }`.

### Server-side rules

1. Look the order up by number via `GET /wc/v3/orders?search=` or by ID.
2. Compare `billing.email` case-insensitively using a **constant-time**
   comparison. A plain `===` leaks timing.
3. Fetch `/wc/v3/orders/{id}/shipment-trackings`.
4. **Return only the fields above.** Never pass the raw WooCommerce order
   through — it contains the full billing address, phone, payment method and
   customer notes.
5. Rate-limit by IP *and* by order number — roughly 5 attempts per 10 minutes.
   Without this, order numbers are sequential and guessable.
6. Never cache a tracking response in a shared cache. Per-request only.

### Cache policy

Tracking is customer-specific and changes without notice. `no-store`. It is the
one part of the storefront that must never be statically rendered.

---

## 7. Real-time carrier events — what it would take

AST free records *the tracking number you enter*. It does **not** poll carriers,
so there is no "In transit → Out for delivery → Delivered" timeline inside our
own UI, and `delivered` will never set itself. The customer gets that detail by
following `trackingUrl` to the carrier's own site.

To show live milestones in our own interface, one of these is required:

| Option | What it gives | Cost / trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TrackShip for WooCommerce** (Zorem) | Purpose-built for AST. Polls 1000+ carriers, writes status back to the order, enables the `delivered` status and per-milestone emails. | Paid subscription, priced per shipment. **Not installed** — explicitly out of scope. |
| **Shiprocket / Delhivery API direct** | Native Indian coverage, webhooks on status change. Shiprocket already aggregates most Indian carriers. | One integration per provider; we own the polling, retries and mapping. Best fit if fulfilment already runs through Shiprocket. |
| **AfterShip / EasyPost** | Carrier-agnostic aggregator with a clean webhook model. | Paid; another vendor holding customer shipment data. |
| **Build it ourselves** | Full control. | Each carrier's API is different and several Indian carriers have no public API. Not worth it at this volume. |

**Recommendation:** ship without real-time events. The tracking link covers the
customer need at launch. If fulfilment moves to Shiprocket, integrate its
webhook directly — it would cover most Indian carriers in one integration and
avoids a second subscription. Revisit TrackShip only if fulfilment stays spread
across many carriers.

Whichever is chosen, the frontend contract in §6 does not change: extra
milestones would arrive as an optional `events[]` array on each shipment.

## 8. Test performed

A dummy order was created and fully exercised, then removed.

| Step | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Order created (`test@example.com`, a reserved non-deliverable domain) | ✅ #33, `processing` |
| Carrier list before configuration | 0 active of 1078 — providers endpoint returned `[]` |
| 9 Indian carriers activated | ✅ providers endpoint populated |
| Tracking added over REST | ✅ 201, `tracking_link` resolved |
| Tracking read back | ✅ identical payload |
| Status after `status_shipped: 1` | ⚠️ `completed` — the §2 finding |
| Store API checked for tracking | ❌ absent |
| Order deleted permanently | ✅ 0 orders, 0 customers |
| Stock restored | ✅ the test order left stock at `-1`; reset to `0` |

`test@example.com` is an IANA-reserved domain that cannot receive mail, so no
real person could have been emailed at any point.
