                  Then, after reading about a major home fire, we asked ourselves that question. We realised that home fire safety had rarely entered those conversations. We had been helping protect the places where people work—but what about the places they call home? That question gave our experience a new purpose.

Created specifically for household preparedness, Graha Kavach helps families take a practical step towards protecting lives, cherished belongings and years of hard work.

              Why an Udaipur home needs a fire safety kit
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground-muted sm:text-base">
              Udaipur&apos;s older city homes with dense, aging wiring and its newer apartment blocks running air conditioners, inverters and kitchen appliances off a single distribution board share the same weak point: an electrical panel or MCB box that rarely gets a second look until something goes wrong. Add a kitchen where an LPG cylinder, hot oil and cotton or synthetic fabric all sit within arm&apos;s reach of each other, and the two most common domestic fire risks in any Rajasthan home are already present before anyone has thought about buying a fire extinguisher. A fire safety kit for home use in Udaipur is not about a rare event — its whole point is that when a pan catches fire or a plug point sparks, the right tool is already mounted on the wall instead of being something you wish you had ordered last week.

          </div>

          <div className="rounded-3xl border border-border bg-white p-8 shadow-xs sm:p-10">

              Made in Udaipur — not just sold here
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground-muted sm:text-base">
              Most fire safety kits listed online are shipped in from somewhere else. Graha Kavach is manufactured by Speciality Geochem, based in Udaipur, Rajasthan, working in the region since 2010. That matters for two practical reasons: replacement parts, refills and support questions are answered by people working in the same state, not a call centre reading from a script; and buying fire safety equipment made in Udaipur keeps the manufacturing and the after-sales relationship in the same place. For a Rajasthan-based household or small business searching for a fire extinguisher supplier near Udaipur, or a fire safety kit made in Rajasthan rather than resold from elsewhere, this is that product.
