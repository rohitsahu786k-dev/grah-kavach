  },
  {
    q: "Which is the best fire extinguisher for home use?",
    a: "It depends on the risks in your home. A 2 kg ABC dry powder extinguisher suits most small household fires, and pairing it with a fire blanket and an automatic fire ball adds coverage for kitchen and electrical risk points.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I use this kit?",
    a: "Use it on small, early-stage fires only. If a fire is spreading or you cannot reach the exit safely, leave the house and call 101 or 112.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the extinguisher capacity?",
    a: "The extinguisher is a 2 kg ABC dry powder unit. It is compact and easy to lift, with a discharge time of roughly 10-12 seconds.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use an ABC fire extinguisher in a home kitchen?",
    a: "It can handle small fires involving solids, liquids and gases. For burning oil in a pan, cover it with the fire blanket instead of spraying.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the automatic fire ball work?",
    a: "Place it near a risk point such as an electrical panel, gas cylinder area or store room. It releases its powder when flame reaches it. It needs no electricity and no one has to operate it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where should I place each item?",
    a: "Keep the extinguisher visible and reachable on your way out. Keep the blanket near the kitchen, within reach without crossing the cooking area. Set the fire ball near the electrical or gas risk point it is meant to cover.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use water on an oil or grease fire?",
    a: "No. Water can spread burning oil and cause a flare-up. Use the fire blanket for a small pan fire.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you deliver the fire safety kit across India?",
    a: "Yes. Graha Kavach delivers across India with free delivery. You can also choose Cash on Delivery by booking with Rs 199 and paying the remaining Rs 2,300 on delivery.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this fire safety kit suitable for flats and apartments?",
    a: "Yes. The kit is compact, and the bracket, stand, screws and wall plugs are included, so you can mount it in a flat, house or shop.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the kit replace the fire service?",
    a: "No. It is meant for small, early-stage fires. If a fire is spreading, evacuate first and call 101 or 112.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I check the kit?",
    a: "Check the extinguisher gauge and the physical condition of all three items every month, and follow the manufacturer's guidance for replacement or servicing.",
